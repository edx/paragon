  There’s a quirk, on Windows, if you have High Contrast mode enabled,
  box-shadow is ignored, as well as outline:none.  But if you have any
  other outline style, it’s be mapped to a high-contrast-appropriate
  default color.  outline:transparent will remap to a visible dotted
  ring when the dropshadow is ignored in HC mode.

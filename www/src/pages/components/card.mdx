  <Card.Body>
    <Card.Title>Card Title</Card.Title>
    <Card.Text>
      Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of
      the card's content.

  </Card.Body>
</Card>
```

      <Card.Text>
        This is a wider card with supporting text below as a natural lead-in to
        additional content. This content is a little bit longer.

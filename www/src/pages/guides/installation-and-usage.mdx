# Installation and usage

Paragon components require React 16 or higher. To install Paragon into your project:

In terminal:

```
npm i --save @edx/paragon
```

In your React project:

```jsx
import { ComponentName } from '@edx/paragon';
```

#### SCSS Foundation

Usage with no theme:

```scss
@import "@edx/paragon/scss/core/core.scss";
```

Usage with a theme:

```scss
@import "@my-brand/fonts.scss";
@import "@my-brand/variables.scss";
// Import the Paragon core after setting brand-themed variables.
@import "@edx/paragon/scss/core/core.scss";
// Import brand overrides after the Paragon core.
@import "@my-brand/overrides.scss";
```

Note that including fonts will affect load performance.  In some pages you may choose not to load the custom font.

# Paragon Documentation

This documentation site serves as the both the documentation and workbench for Paragon. Get started:

1. Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server

```sh
npm start
```

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/` which corresponds to `src/pages/index.mdx`

Edits made to react components in `src/` will be hot-reloaded in this doc site.

## A note about .mdx files 

MDX is a flavor of Markdown that affords writing JSX directly inside markdown files. For more information visit the website: [https://mdxjs.com/](https://mdxjs.com/).
